## Problem Statement

The question we am seeking to answer is whether the number of healthy food stores available in each county can predict the obesity rate. We found data on food deserts from the United States Department of Agriculture. In order to see the relationships between a person's food environment and obesity, the data set consists of the availability of the number of grocery stores, fast food restaurants, and full-service restaurants. Look at which observations have the greatest impact on obesity rates.


## Executive Summary

A food atlas or a “food desert” is an area with limited access to affordable and healthy food. It hard for Americans to eat a healthy diet when they don’t have access to healthy food, and this is a main reason why we still have high obesity rates in many parts of the country. The rate of diabetes among Americans has more than doubled (Ghosh-Dastidat & D. Cohen & G. Hunter & S. N. Zenk & C. Huang & R. Beckman & T. Dubowitz, 2014).  The increases of supermarkets that are a half a mile distance from households have resulted in a lower BMI. A person’s food environment can greatly affect obesity rates in the U.S.  People living in low-income neighborhoods have poorer health and higher rates of obesity (Ghosh-Dastidat et al, 2014). The distance to restaurants, fast food restaurants and grocery stores can impact your eating choices. We seeks to show how your food environment can help determine obesity rates for each county in all fifty states of the U.S. We believe that the number of unhealthy food option will cause an increase the obesity levels in the county. Counties with access to healthier food choices will have a negative correlation with obesity rates. 


Obesity is still a major problem in the United States. Although, we have a better understanding on what is considered a healthy diet, many Americans don’t have access to affordable and healthy food. Americans are also choosing not to follow a healthy lifestyle because of the increased price of the food items. Lower-income households are relying more on “empty calorie” food that are readily available at convenience stores and fast food restaurants (R.E. Walker & Jason Block & Ichiro Kawachi, 2010). The U.S. Office of Agriculture found that 2.3 million people live more than a mile from the grocery store and don’t own a car (R.E. Walker et al, 2010). It is also difficult for large supermarkets to find enough space to build their store in urban areas. As a result, the creation of more supermarkets and grocery stores are seen as undesirable (Chi, Sang-Hyun & Diana S. Grigsby-Toussaint & Natalie Bradford & Jinmu Choi, 2013). In more rural areas, people lack pubic transportation and the number of grocery stores is growing at a much smaller rate as compared to the rate of fast food restaurants. Philadelphia had the second lowest number of supermarkets among other U.S. major cities and lower income neighborhood at thirty percent less food stores than higher income neighborhoods (R.E. Walker et al, 2010). The emergence of food deserts came with more upper class households leaving the cities to go to the suburban areas (R.E. Walker & Jason Block & Ichiro Kawachi, 2010). Studies have found that obesity stems from unhealthy eating habits. Americans have limited access to adequate food and people are at risk for food insecurity and obesity (Ghosh-Dastidat et al, 2014). The U.S. has one of the highest rates in food insecurity when compared to other countries. In order to combat obesity, we need to make is a priority that everyone has equal access to affordable and healthier food choices. A healthy food environment refers to having easy access to supermarkets, farmers markets and convenience stores.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

This analysis showed how access to different types of food stores could impact obesity rates among adults and found that there is a statistically significant relationship between the number of fast food restaurants and obesity among children and adults. However, the RMSE scores were not very low so the model did not represent strong evidence that these factors were the only variables affecting obesity. In the U.S., healthier food items tend to be a lot more expensive than the unhealthy food items. As result, even if the counties had a lot of different food options and easy access to healthier food stores, a low-income household will choose the cheapest option and ignore the health consequences. The region of the U.S. is also very important factor that accounts for the obesity levels. Some counties had a small number of grocery stores and access to healthy food options, and many households do not have access to a car. The lack of access to supermarkets has a greater chance of health challenges such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Unhealthy food may be a lot cheaper in the short run but there is significant evidence that unhealthy eating will lead to diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other life threatening diseases. The consequences in the long run are a lot worse. In order to end obesity in the U.S., we need to make the healthier food options more affordable. If I were to conduct this study again, I would want to look at prices of the food items and make interaction terms with the price variables and the stores variables. Prices have a lot of impact on what Americans choose to eat. Therefore, the regression with food prices might have a higher score and show a stronger relationship to the obesity rate in adults.
