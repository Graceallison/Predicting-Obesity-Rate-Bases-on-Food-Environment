## Executive Summary


The question I am seeking to answer is whether the number of healthy food stores available in each county can predict the obesity rate in each county. I found data on food deserts from the United States Department of Agriculture. In order to see the relationships between a person's food environment and obesity, the data set consists of the availability of the number of grocery stores, fast food restaurants, and full-service restaurants. The data also puts into account the number of households without cars and is more than a mile away from grocery stores. The data consist of 3,139 observations and the number of grocery stores, full-service restaurants, and fast-food restaurants was calculated for each county. The percent change for the obesity level and the types of restaurants were calculated between 2007–2011. I expect the data to show a strong relationship between the number of fast-food restaurants and full-service restaurants to the obesity rate for adults.

This study successfully showed how access to different types of food stores could impact obesity rates among adults. I rejected my null hypothesis since the study found that there is a correlation between access to fast food and restaurants and obesity among children and adults. However, the R² value was not very high so the model did not represent strong evidence that these factors were the only variables affecting obesity. In the U.S., healthier food items tend to be a lot more expensive than unhealthy food items. As a result, even if the counties had a lot of different food options and easy access to healthier food stores, a low-income household will choose the cheapest option and ignore the health consequences.
